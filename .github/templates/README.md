# Templates

This folder contains templates that can be copied into real projects:

- `docs/` — RST templates for ASPICE-style documentation:
  - Software architecture
  - Detailed design
  - Unit test specification
  - Integration test specification
  - Test report

- `code/` — “Good” embedded C and test templates:
  - Typical MISRA-style C module header & source
  - Google Test unit test skeleton

The idea:

- Use these as **starting points** in real repositories.
- Adapt IDs, naming, and sections to your project.
- Keep this repo as the canonical source of templates and evolve them as you learn.
